[] You'll need an Apache (others might work) vhost with mod_rewrite
(but only for the non-top static pages).
See conf/VHOST.sample for an idea

[] Above Apache will need to have PHP rocking and rolling

[] You'll need to create a database in MySQL 5 and
then dump:
  -] sql/mapanese_structure.sql
  -] sql/mapanese_data.sql
into it.

[] Edit conf/gh-mapanese.home_conf.php to have the appropriate
MySQL access credentials

[] You should be good to go now
