WHAT IS IT?
~~~~~~~~~~~

It is an *English language enabling* of Google Maps' map of Japan.
This means that places have English labels and searches for Japanese
addresses can be performed using English.


WHAT DOES IT NEED TO RUN?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[] Apache webserver (others might work)
[] PHP 5 (4 might work) with the mbstring extension
[] MySQL 5


WHAT'S HOT?
~~~~~~~~~~~

[] Search in English to get the Japanese address or..
[] ..search in Japanese to get the English address!
[] Performs address translation even with no JavaScript
[] Search for full or partial addresses
[] Freeform search box

WHAT'S NOT?

has caught up with - and overtaken - pretty much all of the once
unique features of Mapanese :-(
