# Mapanese

## What is it?

It is an *English language enabling* of Google Maps' map of Japan. This means that places have English labels and searches for Japanese addresses can be performed using English.

Mapanese は Google マップ(日本国)上に、英語／ローマ字の場所名を付ける、英語／ローマ字の住所検索を使用可能にするソフトです。

## What does it need to run?

* Apache webserver (others might work)
* PHP 5 (4 might work) with the mbstring extension
* MySQL 5 (where you can create Unicode tables / rows)

## What's hot?

* Search in English to get the Japanese address or..
* ..search in Japanese to get the English address!
* Performs address translation even with no JavaScript
* Search for full or partial addresses
* Freeform search box

## What's not?

* No real USPs anymore since plain vanilla Google Maps' map of Japan has caught up with - and overtaken - pretty much all of the once unique features of Mapanese :-(
* 現在、普通の Google マップ(日本国)も Mapanese の機能を対応しています。(T_T)
